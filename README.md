Before we delve into the Shift-Left Security strategy, let's first understand what DevSecOps is

**Dev+Sec+Ops**, **__As Shannon Lietz - founder at DevSecOps foundation - said:__**<br>
The purpose and intent of DevSecOps is to build on the mindset that “everyone is responsible for security” with the goal of safely distributing security decisions at speed and scale to those who hold the highest level of context without sacrificing the safety required.”

**Shift-left security strategy**<br>
<font face="Arial">As a simple definition, the shift-left security strategy is a way or solution to embedding security as a part of our development process and **_consider security from the inception steps of application or system design_**. In other words, **_security is responsible for everyone who works in the software development and operating process._** Of course, security is a profession and we need highly skilled people to play security-related roles; but in this approach, any designer, software architecture, developer, DevOps engineer, and together with security guys have liability about security.</span></font>

# Shift-left security strategy
The concept of "leftshift" in DevSecOps emphasizes integrating security early (shift-left) in the development lifecycle. This model focuses on embedding security practices from the very beginning of the development process.

<h2>Training:</h2>

<h3>Training is a crucial component of the Shift-Left Security Maturity Model, which focuses on integrating security practices early in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Here’s a structured approach to incorporating training into each stage of the Shift-Left Security Maturity Model.</h3>

<h4>STAGE1:</br></h4>Introduce foundational concepts of security and its importance in the SDLC.
Educate teams about the benefits and goals of integrating security early in the development process.
Introduction to the Shift-Left approach and its benefits for security.

Introduce fundamental security concepts and common vulnerabilities.

<h4>STAGE2:</br></h4>Train teams on standardized security practices and tools.
Teach how to incorporate security checks into the development process.
Educate developers on secure coding techniques and common vulnerabilities.
Introduction to threat modeling methodologies and how to apply them.
Training on using security tools integrated into the development pipeline (e.g., static analysis, SAST).
Establish security requirements and policies.</br>Document these requirements and ensure they are accessible to all teams.</br>
Develop Guideline Documents: Input Parameter Validation Guidelines.</br>
Security Coding Guidelines, Sensitive Data Discovery Guidance for Development Teams.</br>
API/Web/Mobile/Thick Client/Hardware Security and Privacy Guidelines

<h4>STAGE3:</h4>
Advance training to include integration of security practices into CI/CD pipelines.
Foster collaboration between development, security, and operations teams.
Training on integrating security tools and practices into CI/CD pipelines.
Best practices for cross-functional team collaboration on security issues.
Conduct workshops that simulate real-world scenarios and involve cross-functional teams.</br>
Encourage developers to take ownership of security by creating a security champions program. 
Introducing Tainings/Work Instructions.</br>
Security and Privacy Risk Management Procedure.</br>
Security and Privacy Risk Management SAST Work Instructions.</br>
Security and Privacy Risk Management DAST Work Instructions.</br> 
Cryptography and Key Management Standard</br>

<h4>STAGE4:</h4>
Understanding and applying metrics and KPIs to evaluate security effectiveness.
Conduct workshops focused on understanding and applying security metrics.
Security & Privacy touch point sessions.</br>
Introducing advanced trainings</br>
Insider Threat Mitigation Program Procedure.</br>
Open Source Software Vulnerability Management Procedure.

<h4>STAGE5:</h4>
Align security training with overall business objectives and strategic goals.
Promote continuous innovation and adaptation in security practices.
Training on aligning security practices with business strategy and objectives.</br>
Train leaders on how to drive a security-focused culture and strategic alignment.</br>
Develop leadership training programs focused on security strategy and culture.</br>
Create well-defined Security Exception procedure and document.</br>
